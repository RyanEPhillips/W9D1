# Algorithms README

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental algorithms in Python: Linear Search and Bubble Sort.

## Linear Search

### Description

Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because it may have to iterate through all elements to find the target.

### Optimizations and Trade-offs

- **Optimizations**: There are no significant optimizations for linear search beyond improving how you handle edge cases or special conditions within the loop.
  
- **Trade-offs**: It has a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for small lists but can be slow for very large lists compared to a binary search.

## Bubble Sort

### Description

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because it involves nested loops iterating over the list.

### Optimizations and Trade-offs

- **Optimizations**: 
  - Early termination if no swaps are needed in a pass, indicating the list is already sorted.

- **Trade-offs**: 
  - While simple to implement, bubble sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity.
  - It is not suitable for large arrays or lists.

## Comparison and Conclusion

Both linear search and bubble sort are fundamental algorithms with straightforward implementations. However, their efficiency can be limited for larger datasets.

### Future Considerations

For larger datasets or applications requiring higher performance, consider exploring more advanced algorithms like binary search for searching.
