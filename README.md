# Algorithms README

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental algorithms in Python: Linear Search and Bubble Sort.

## Linear Search

### Description

Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

## Bubble Sort

### Description

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
